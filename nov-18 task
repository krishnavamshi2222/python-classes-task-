Tuple

#Create two tuples (1,4,5,6,7,8) (5,6,7,8,9)
#Find the common elements between two tuples
#Concatenate both tuples and remove duplicates from tuple
#Find the index value of 9 (after concatenation)
#multiply above elements 3 times

Sets

#Create two empty sets
#update set1 with 7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,0
#update set2 with 4,5,6,0
#check whether set2 is subset of set1 or no ?
#check whether both have common elements are no ?
#remove 8 from set 1 and set 2 ==> find the inferences
#discard 0 from set1 and set2 
#find collection of both sets ===> set1 and set2

Dictionary:

#create a dictionary
#{1:["english","maths","science"], 2:[10,20,30], 3:["bio-botany","bio-zoology","Algebra"]}
#Extract "bobtn" from above dictionary
#Extract "arbeg" from above dictionary
#print all keys in dictionary and convert it into tuple
#Find the average of all numbers available under key "2"
